## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://vite.dev/guide/cli.html#build) for more information.

The coomand will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` folder.

It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
